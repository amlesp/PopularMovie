# PopularMovie Android App

## Project Overview
This is P2 (final stage) project Popular Movies created as a part of Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program. Goal is to learn how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices.
The app uses [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to retrive data so it is necessary to provide your own API KEY and put it in gradle.properties file.

## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

## Common Project Requirements
- App is written solely in the Java Programming Language.
- App conforms to common standards found in the [Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html).
- App utilizes stable release versions of all libraries, Gradle, and Android Studio.
## User Interface - Layout
- UI contains an element (e.g., a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.
- Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.
- UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.
- Movie Details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
- Movie Details layout contains a section for displaying trailer videos and user reviews.
## User Interface - Function
- When a user changes the sort criteria (most popular, highest rated, and favorites) the main view gets updated correctly.
- When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.
- When a trailer is selected, app uses an Intent to launch the trailer.
- In the movies detail screen, a user can tap a button (for example, a star) to mark it as a Favorite. Tap the button on a favorite movie will unfavorite it.
## Network API Implementation
- In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.
- App requests for related videos for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/videos endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.
- App requests for user reviews for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/reviews endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.
## Data Persistence
- The titles and IDs of the userâ€™s favorite movies are stored in a native SQLite database and exposed via a ContentProvider
- Data is updated whenever the user favorites or unfavorites a movie. No other persistence libraries are used.
- When the "favorites" setting option is selected, the main view displays the entire favorites collection based on movie ids stored in the database.
